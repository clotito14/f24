## Semester Goals 

I want to maximize my time learning; as it is my final year, there are a bounty of subjects that I need to dig my teeth into.

I want to learn how to bridge the gap between the analog and digital world. Hopefully in Senior Design, I can be apart of a project that takes analog measurements, converts it into useful digital signals, and then create a data-pipeline which stores and provides a base for useful analyzation.

### Course Descriptions

_These course descriptions were found in the [SIUC course catalog](https://catalog.siu.edu/index.pdf)._ 

| Course | Description |
| :------: | :----------- |
|  ECE469  | Basic machine learning concepts: Model selection, feature scaling, bias-variance trade-off, regularization, Performance metrics and validation techniques, Probability and statistics review. Supervised learning: Linear/non-linear regression and logistic regression, Generalized linear models, Generative learning models, Bayes decision theory, Naive Bayes classifier, Nearest neighbor classifiers, Hidden-Markov models, Support vector machines, Kernel methods, Bagging, Boosting. Unsupervised Learning: Clustering: K-means, Expectation-maximization, Anomaly detection, Dimensionality Reduction: Principal components analysis, transform techniques. Basics of reinforcement learning and deep learning.|
| ECE385 | Power in single phase and three-phase circuits. Magnetic circuits, voltage induction, electromagnetic force. Power transformers. AC machines: synchronous machines; synchronous motors; induction motors. DC machines. |
|ECE495E| Capstone Design part 1. Preparation for professional electrical engineering practice with a major design experience based on earlier coursework, incorporating appropriate engineering standards and multiple constraints. Includes aspects of project development and design within a team such as communicating, establishing goals, planning tasks, meeting deadlines, analyzing risk, and fulfilling responsibilities professionally and ethically. |
|MATH450| Multivariable calculus fundamental to continuum mechanics, differential geometry, electromagnetism, relativity, thermodynamics, etc. Includes: parametric curves and surfaces, inverse and implicit function theorems, contraction mapping and fixed point theorems, differentials, convergence of multivariate integrals, coordinate systems in space, Jacobians, surfaces, volumes and Green's, Gauss', and Stokes' theorems. |
|MUS106| A history and appreciation of the musical and cultural melting pot of 1950's rock & roll and early 1960's pop. Includes overview of the African American roots and female ancestors and influences on blues, boogie-woogie, jazz, swing, country & western, gospel and popular music, and the crossover success of rhythm & blues acts that marked the true birth of rock & roll. Cultural influences, racial background and gender identification are relevant. |
