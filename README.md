## Semester Goals 

I want to maximize my time learning; as it is my final year, there are a bounty of subjects that I need to dig my teeth into.

I want to learn how to bridge the gap between the analog and digital world. Hopefully in Senior Design, I can be apart of a project that takes analog measurements, converts it into useful digital signals, and then create a data-pipeline which stores and provides a base for useful analyzation.
